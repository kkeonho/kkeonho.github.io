# Immersed peridynamics method
Fluid-driven material damage and failure are significant problems in many engineering and industrial fields. To accurately and efficiently model such a complex failure process, we integrate a classical immersed boundary-type method with a nonlocalization of continuum mechanics called peridynamics.
